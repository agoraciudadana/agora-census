Technical stuff:
    * Backbone
    * Phonegap
    * GoRatchet (styles)

Init js:
    * static/js/init.js

    This script creates the basic html divs and includes js. To add a view
    you should add a new Init.divs entry and all needed Init.js.
    The Init.divs entry should be the field "el".

Backbone routes:
    * static/js/router.js

    To add a new view to the app you should add it to the router.
    The route entry should be the field "route" if the view extends
    Acensus.View

Templates:
    * static/js/templates/all.js

    Script generated using /templates/underscore/*.html
    This script is generated using compile_templates.sh. Before run
    compile_templates.js you should ejectue "npm install ." in the www
    directory to install grunt dependencies.

    After changes in underscore templates you should run
    compile_templates.sh.

API:
    * static/js/api.js

    Calls to the api should go in this file. Currently all calls are fake
    calls.

Android:
    To run this app in android you should run:
    $ phonegap run android

    To use the real icon, you should ejecute:
    $ python genicons.py
    After one first run. Then all run will work with the correct icon.

Development:
    To development without android you can use the django server:
    $ cd acensus/
    $ python manage.py runserver
    $ firefox http://localhost:8000/
